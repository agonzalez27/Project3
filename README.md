##General approach
We began by addressing the issue of volatility in the stock market.  An emerging trend in technology is prediction markets for which we found a great example in the arena of politics with **[PredicIt](www.predictit.org).**  We decided to apply a similar concept to the stock market and see if we could create a web app that would make daily predictions of stock behaviour using a mathematical concept called "Wisdom of the Crowd".  

### *Wisdom Of The Crowd*
*A large group's aggregated answers to questions involving quantity estimation, general world knowledge, and spatial reasoning has generally been found to be as good as, and often better than, the answer given by any of the individuals within the group.*

##Unsolved Problems
* Unable to lock in stock prediction after the first two hours of market being open and have it cleared out by the next day.
* Finding a way to aggregate and display average of user's predictions on single stock.
* Using a html template interfered with the use of Materialize.
* Markit On Demand API allows limited number of API calls
